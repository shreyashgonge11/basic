        <p>
            Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, was a prominent leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against British rule. Born in 1828, she became the queen of Jhansi through her marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao. Following her husband's death in 1853, the British East India Company annexed Jhansi, triggering her fierce resistance.
            Lakshmi Bai emerged as a courageous and skilled military leader, leading her troops in a prolonged and valiant defense of her kingdom. Despite facing overwhelming British forces, she demonstrated exceptional bravery and strategic prowess. Her leadership inspired many, and her resistance became a symbol of Indian defiance against colonial rule.
            After Jhansi fell to the British in 1858, she continued to fight, eventually dying in battle. Rani Lakshmi Bai is celebrated as a national hero in India for her unyielding courage and commitment to the fight for freedom. Her legacy remains a powerful emblem of resistance and patriotism.

        <p>
            Madam Bhikaji Cama was a prominent Indian freedom fighter and one of the earliest advocates for India's independence. During the 1907 International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart, Germany, Madam Bhikaji Cama unfurled the first version of the Indian national flag, which was designed by her. This flag was a tricolor of green, yellow, and red, 
            with a symbol of a lotus and a crescent on it. This event was a significant moment in India's struggle for independence, as it showcased a symbol of Indian nationalism on an international stage. The flag represented the Indian national movement and was an early attempt to unify the diverse regions of India under a single symbol of independence
            and pride. Although this design was not adopted officially, it laid the groundwork for future developments in the design of the Indian flag. Madam Bhikaji Cama's work was instrumental in fostering a sense of national identity and pride among Indians and played a crucial role in the country's journey towards independence.

            Avani Lekhara is an Indian Paralympic shooter who made history at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics by becoming the first 
            Indian woman to win a gold medal at the Paralympics. She won the gold in the women's 10m air rifle standing SH1 event, 
            setting a Paralympic record and equaling the world record. Avani was left paralyzed from the 
            waist down after a car accident in 2012 but found inspiration in shooting through Abhinav Bindra's autobiography.
            In addition to her gold, she also secured a bronze medal in the 50m rifle 3 positions SH1 event at the same Games, 
            making her the first Indian woman to win multiple medals in a single Paralympics. Avani is also an advocate for disability 
            rights, using her platform to promote inclusivity in sports and beyond. Her journey is an inspiring story of resilience, determination, and breaking barriers for athletes with disabilities in India
