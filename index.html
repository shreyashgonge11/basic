        <img src="background/Rani laksmibai.jpg" alt="Rani Laxmi Bai">
        <p>Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, was a prominent leader during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against British rule. Born in 1828, she became the queen of Jhansi through her marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao. Following her husband's death in 1853, the British East India Company annexed Jhansi, triggering her fierce resistance.

            Lakshmi Bai emerged as a courageous and skilled military leader, leading her troops in a prolonged and valiant defense of her kingdom. Despite facing overwhelming British forces, she demonstrated exceptional bravery and strategic prowess. Her leadership inspired many, and her resistance became a symbol of Indian defiance against colonial rule.
            
            After Jhansi fell to the British in 1858, she continued to fight, eventually dying in battle. Rani Lakshmi Bai is celebrated as a national hero in India for her unyielding courage and commitment to the fight for freedom. Her legacy remains a powerful emblem of resistance and patriotism.</p>

      <p>
            Madam Bhikaji Cama was a prominent Indian freedom fighter and one of the earliest advocates for India's independence. During the 1907 International Socialist Congress in Stuttgart, Germany, Madam Bhikaji Cama unfurled the first version of the Indian national flag, which was designed by her. This flag was a tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a symbol of a lotus and a crescent on it. This event was a significant moment in India's struggle for independence, as it showcased a symbol of Indian nationalism on an international stage. The flag represented the Indian national movement and was an early attempt to unify the diverse regions of India under a single symbol of independence and pride. Although this design was not adopted officially, it laid the groundwork for future developments in the design of the Indian flag. Madam Bhikaji Cama's work was instrumental in fostering a sense of national identity and pride among Indians and played a crucial role in the country's journey towards independence.</p>

      <img src="background/rakhmabai raut.jpeg.jpg" alt="rakhmabai raut">
      <p>
        Rukhmabai Raut was one of the first practicing female doctors in India and a pioneering figure in the fight against child marriage and women's rights. Born in 1864, she was married off at 
        the age of 11 but refused to live with her husband, leading to a landmark legal battle in the 1880s, known as the Rukhmabai case. This case sparked widespread debate on child marriage and 
        women's autonomy in British India. Later, she pursued medical education in England, becoming a qualified doctor in 1894. Upon her return to India, Rukhmabai served as a physician in Surat 
        and Rajkot, dedicating her life to women's healthcare and social reform. Her work laid the foundation for future generations of Indian women in medicine and activism.
